#To do

In order of importance

[] You win functionality
[] Hint used-up letters to player (like on the official Wordle keyboard)
[] Better UI design
[] Make text input boxes not scrollable
[] Make autofill not show up on boxes
[] Get daily random word from a backend instead of generating new one locally every app launch
